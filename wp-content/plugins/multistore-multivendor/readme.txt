This plugin allows you to show WooCommerce products on different domains or subdomains to make a multistore WooCommerce website.

== Description ==
This plugin allows you to make multiple front end eCommerce websites with WordPress and WooCommerce, from just a single, simple installation of WordPress.

Suppose you have a WordPress site example.com. It contains 100 products. You want to show some of them on garments.example.com, some on my-eshop.com and some products on mobiles.example.com. See? you can show your WooCommerce products across multiple subdomains and even on separate domains. 

How to do it? Very simple. To setup a new subdomain for example, mobiles.example.com, do the following:

- Install this plugin and activate it.

- Point mobiles.example.com to your main website server. This may require changing of DNS records. On many hosting providers this process is called creating a "Domain Alias" or Add-on domain. The target is that if you browse your new domain or subdomain, it should show the content as you see on your main site.

- Create a new 'Contributor' type user.
- Put https://mobiles.example.com in his site url field and save.

- Now, go in Products and set that author to those products in WooCommerce, which you want to show on mobiles.example.com.

- That's it. Now browse https://mobiles.example.com and you will see products made by the contributor user of this site.
